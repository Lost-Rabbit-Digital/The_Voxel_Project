# Optimisations
 - Add frustum culling for chunks
 - Implement chunk loading/unloading based on distance
 - Add LOD (Level of Detail) system for distant chunks
 - Use multithreading for chunk generation
 - Implement greedy meshing to combine adjacent faces
 - Add a priority queue based on distance to player
 - Implement chunk caching/serialization
 - Use GPU instancing for mesh generation


Add texture support for the different material types?
Implement smoother transitions between materials?
Add additional terrain features like caves or overhangs?
